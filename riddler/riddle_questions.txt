I am the beginning of the end, and the end of time and space. I am essential to creation, and I surround every place. What am I?
What always runs but never walks, often murmurs, never talks, has a bed but never sleeps, has a mouth but never eats?
I never was, am always to be. No one ever saw me, nor ever will. And yet I am the confidence of all, To live and breathe on this terrestrial ball. What am I?
At night they come without being fetched. By day they are lost without being stolen. What are they?
What is in seasons, seconds, centuries and minutes but not in decades, years or days?
The person who makes it, sells it. The person who buys it never uses it and the person who uses it doesn't know they are. What is it?
The more you have of it, the less you see. What is it?
What has a head, a tail, is brown, and has no legs?
What English word has three consecutive double letters?
What's black when you get it, red when you use it, and white when you're all through with it?
I am always hungry, I must always be fed, The finger I touch, Will soon turn red.
I know a word of letters three. Add two, and fewer there will be.
I have four legs but no tail. Usually I am heard only at night. What am I?
